## Adding up times

> Some array work where we throw everything together!

### Practice

Look at the following file:

```
2. Vanilla Javascript/09 - Adding Up Times with Reduce/index-START.html
```

1. We have a list of li items. Select all of them based on the data attribute. Use the [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector). Create an array from the NodeList.

2. Loop over the nodes and create an array of only the times.

3. Loop over the times and calculate the number of seconds.

4. Loop over the seconds and add them up.

5. Calculate the number of hours from the total amount of seconds.

6. Calculate the number of minutes from the total amount of seconds **while not counting the hours**. Hint: calculate the modulo.

7. Log how much total hours, minutes and seconds we have for all the `li` combined.
