## Key sequence detection

### Practice

Look at the following file:

```
2. Vanilla Javascript/10 - Key Sequence Detection/index-START.html
```

1. Create a variable that contains a string. This string is your secret code ðŸ¥·.

2. Add an event listener on window that listens for keystrokes

3. Store all the keystroks in an array

4. If you join all the strokes and they match your secret code, execute this function `cornify_add();`

Here are some resources to refresh you knowledge on event listeners in javascript:
