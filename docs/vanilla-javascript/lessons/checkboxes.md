## 11 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes

### Practice

Look at the following file:

```
2. Vanilla Javascript/11 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes/index-START.html
```

1. Select all the checkboxes (input fields). Use the [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll)

2. Write a function handleCheck that checks if they had the shift key down AND check that they are checking a checkbox. Loop over all the checkboxes and set them to checked if they are between the lastChecked item and the currently checked item.

3. Attach the handleCheck function on click on all the checkboxes.
