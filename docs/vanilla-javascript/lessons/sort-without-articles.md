## Sort without Articles

> Some more Array work!

### Practice

Look at the following file:

```
2. Vanilla Javascript/07 - Sort Without Articles/index-START.html
```

1. We have an array of articles

2. Create a function named strip. This function will look for Articles (a, the, an) and remove them.

3. create a sort function that uses the strip function and sorts alphabatically.

4. select the #bands ul elements and set the `innerHTML` equal to a list of `li` with the name of the band in it. Use the [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector)
