## Dev Tools Domination

![devtools](../../static/devtools.png)

There are three tabs at the top of the Developer Tools window, and a further six that you can see by clicking the >> symbol next to them.

The tabs are:

1. Elements
2. Console
3. Source
4. Network
5. Application
6. Security
7. Memory
8. Performance
9. Audits

**Elements** shows you the HTML used to build the page you’re looking at, together with any inline CSS.

**Console** deals with JavaScript. It gives you information about interactive elements on a page. In Console, you can write JavaScript to interact with the web page you’re viewing, and it also lets you write messages to yourself in the JavaScript of websites you’re building, which then show up in Console to show that the JS was executed.

The **Sources** tab shows you where all the files that were used to make the website are stored and lets you inspect them.

The **Network** tab shows you all the files that are loading in the URL you’re looking at.

**Application** shows you what’s in your browser storage: in-browser databases like Web SQL, local storage, and more. It also gives you granular control over your cookies.

**Security** gives you basic security information, letting you view a site’s HTTPS certificate and TLS status.

For our excercises, we are going to focus on the console. The console is a very handy tool for debugging and understanding what is going on within your application. We are going to work with the console object.
